# MyCaliber

The code implements *My*elinated axon *Caliber* estimation in [Hong-Hsi Lee et al. 2025](), a new technique for axonal diameter mapping from myelin water diffusion.

* **Demo 1, radial diffusivity of cylindrical surface (zero thickness)**
* **Demo 2, radial diffusivity of cylindrical shell (finite thickness)**
* **Demo 3, axonal diamter mapping of cylindrical shell (finite thickness)**
* **Demo 4, radial and axial diffusivities of cylindrical shell (finite thickness) with beading and undulation**
* **Demo 5, axonal diamter mapping of cylindrical shell (finite thickness) with beading and undulation**
* **Demo 6, comparison of analysitcal solutions of finite thickness and zero thickness**
